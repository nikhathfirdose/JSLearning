   Syntax: array.splice(index, howmany, item1, ....., itemX)

4. to resolve local and remote git issues: git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
5. innerText vs innerHTML: Unlike innerText, though, innerHTML lets you work with HTML rich text and doesn't automatically encode and decode text. In other words, innerText retrieves and sets the content of the tag as plain text, whereas innerHTML retrieves and sets the content in HTML format.
6. JSON.stringify() : Local storage can only save strings, so storing objects requires that they be converted into strings using JSON. stringify before storing them.
   ==> JSON.stringify() convert [] to a str. But for it to behave as an object it has to be parsed ==> JSON.parse()
7. remove staged files: git rm --cached [filename.js]
